## Electronic Flight Bag (EFB)
Welcome to the electronic flight bag implementation!

### Testing
You can run a standalone version of the EFB by running the following:

```
$ npm install
$ npx webpack serve -c webpack.development.config.js
```

Then, navigate to http://localhost:8080.

The native resolution of the EFB in the sim is 1430x1000. 

In Chrome and Firefox dev tools, enable Responsive Design Mode (tablet and phone icon) and select this resolution to display it as it would appear in the sim.
